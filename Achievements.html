            To this day, Digital Day 2023 has been my favourite day of school so far, 
            A day full of problem solving, computing, design and presentation is my ideal day. And that's exactly what I got.
            Firstly I teamed up with my best friends, Alex and Mat, expanding our group by joining Aidan and Olivia. Presented with our challenge, we got to work.
            We assigned each person taking on different segments of our big plan to help Vue Entertainment, I worked on a program (using scratch) to showcase one of our main ideas. 
            Spending lots of time perfecting it, as well as helping in other areas such as the power point we made to showcase our ideas. Miscellaneous tasks were easy and quick to complete, 
            that overall elevated our presentation to a much higher standard. We included a QR code to the scratch game, giving everyone partaking in the challenge a chance to play the demo, it was a great success.
            After we were selected by the schools judges to present to BIMA, we recorded our presentation and sent it off. A couple weeks later, we got our results.<b> Coming first in Scotland </b>was an extraordinarily
            euphoric experience. Winning 2 free view tickets was also a huge bonus! Overall, I loved the whole experience and would always do it again.

            Over the course of a couple of months, with a couple of lessons every week with my mentor <i>Yogesh Kumar</i> I built my <a href="Portfolio.html#firstgame" class="noformatting">first game</a> in Unreal engine.
            I coded in blueprint, and made my own textures, using some assets from the Unreal engine store and some assets from Quixel Bridge, all coming together to produce my first ever game. Designing the levels and having
            complete control over what features I wanted, all I had to do was make them. I was commended by my mentor who congratulated me on my innovation and features that I had added myself. One such feature was a recreation of the
            `glass bridge` from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game" target="_blank" class="noformatting">squid game,</a>as well as a ball that rolls behind you, chasing you through a maze. After I was happy with the implementation,
            I recorded some gameplay, took some images, and finally launched it on itch! I remember it as feeling of accomplishment, and watching my friend make his way through the levels on his own computer was a great experience.

            I have won a fair amount of awards throughout my life; these include Best Digital Trench, an award I received for my <a href="Projects.html#schoolIntergration" class="noformatting">digital trench
            </a>model that I produced in Unreal Engine. I won this award for History. Speaking of school awards In the 2022-2023 season, I won 7 merit awards for subjects I was taking at the time. A final award I`ll mention in this paragraph is the Gold robotics Scratch camp award, 
            I won this award during a summer camp for robotics in Singapore it was awarded to the best students in the class. I was one of the select few that received this award, primarily for my consistency of creative ways of solving problems.

            Throughout my time at school I`ve always tried to put my best foot forward. Trying my best with homework, assignments and assessments, which allowed me to reach the grades I uphold to this day,
            I`ve had these high standards for myself since a young age. Trying my best to achieve grades that not only make myself happy, but also those around me. <b>Recently, in my prelims, I got straight A's for all my subjects</b> which I was extremely delighted about. 
            I also love engaging with clubs within school. One that I have attended regularly is the magazine club. 
            I have been highly commended for my work on it, producing high quality content to be published on the school website. Throughout my time and work, I`ve been continually recognised, and eventually was given the title of <i>editor</i>.
